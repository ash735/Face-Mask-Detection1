# Face-Mask-Detection1
Developed a computer vision model to detect whether individuals are wearing face masks in images and real-time video streams.
•	Preprocessed image data using OpenCV from publicly available datasets.
•	Built a CNN model with Keras, incorporating regularization techniques for improved accuracy.
•	Integrated model with OpenCV for real-time video inference.
Outcome: Delivered a robust face mask detection system suitable for public safety use cases.
